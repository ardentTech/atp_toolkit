# ATP Toolkit
A collection of Kotlin-based tools for working with the AT Protocol from [Bluesky](https://atproto.com/specs/atp).

## TODO?
* `AtpLexicon.Builder` - allow progressive building and delayed instantiation for UIs
* `AtpLexicon` type-safe DSL?
* E2E tests
* Create concrete dataclass files based on lexicon JSON
* Better `JsonBuilder` management

## Resources
* [AT Protocol Lexicon spec](https://atproto.com/specs/lexicon)
