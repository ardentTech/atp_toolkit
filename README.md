# ATP Toolkit
A collection of Kotlin-based tools for working with the AT Protocol from [Bluesky](https://atproto.com/specs/atp).

## TODO?
* `atp.Lexicon.Builder` - allow progressive building and delayed instantiation for UIs?
* `atp.Lexicon` type-safe DSL?
* E2E tests
* `writeLexicon` - create concrete dataclass mappings based on lexicon JSON

## Resources
* [AT Protocol Lexicon spec](https://atproto.com/specs/lexicon)
