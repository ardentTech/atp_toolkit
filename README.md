# ATP Toolkit
A collection of Kotlin-based tools for working with the AT Protocol from [Bluesky](https://atproto.com/specs/atp).

## Setup
TODO once published to public repo

## Produce Lexicons
The toolkit provides a variety of ways to create valid AT Protocol Lexicons:
1. Object instantiation 
2. Type-safe DSL (COMING SOON)

## Consume Lexicons
The toolkit will someday allow you to consume Lexicon files and create data mappings from them.

## TODO
* integration tests
* demo area (e.g. hang a builder off a companion object)
* logging
* test creating lexicons
